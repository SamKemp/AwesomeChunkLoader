This version of AwesomeChunkLoader for Sponge is intended to allow server owners to have better control over chunkloading. Often this control cannot be easily obtained through mods that provide ChunkLoaders. This version is NOT compatible with datastores used by original versions of BetterChunkLoader.

For instructions on how to use and or configure AwesomeChunkLoader check out our [Wiki]
